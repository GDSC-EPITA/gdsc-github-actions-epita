# Workflow 2: Steps to publish a package workflow

## Add a workflow that publishes an PyPy package and creates
1. Register a test.pypy account: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and add an API Token in your account https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/
2. **Setting -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New Repository Secret**: Add a new repository secret in your repository with the name **TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN**  
3. Add a workflow file at this directory `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
    - Checkout
    - Set up python
    - Install build dependencies `setuptools wheel build` 
    - Publish the package to pypy with this actions `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1` with password and repository_url (https://test.pypi.org/legacy/)

## Watch your actions come to life!

1. Merge the pull request and check that your workflow completes successfully
2. Check on the `Action` tab that the release action has completed
3. Check on pypy that your package is visible

## Use your package

You can now download and use your python package:  
`python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package`
```python
import example.simple
print(example.simple.say("Hello"))
```
